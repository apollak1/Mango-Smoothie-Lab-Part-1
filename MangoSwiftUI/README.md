# Mango Smoothie : App Dev with SwiftUI I : Lab 1
 
 In this lab I would like you to create a small display of a Mango Smoothie
 
 There should be three pieces of text displayed in your app preview
 The top piece of text should say "Mango Smoothie" and have a large or title font size. The text underneath this should say the ingredients of the mango smoothie "Mango, Banana, Water" and be smaler than the title text. The bottom-most text should say "320 calories", and have the same font size as the middle-text
 
 You will also need to add a total of 6 circles.
 
 The first circle should be to the LEFT of the text and be large and have the color green. (Hint: A HStack can matchup the text and this circle)
 Underneath the text and circle you should have five small blue circles horizontally aligned.
 
 Please review the expected output section for more information.
 
 Have fun!
